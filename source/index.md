# SOC Documentation

Here lies the documentation of the Student run Security Operations Center at the California Polytechnic State University, Pomona.

Why volunteer at the SOC? Because you get to do cool things:
- Gain hands-on experience working at a Security Operation Center
- Investigate security events and logs using SIEMs like Splunk
- Automate tasks for security analysts using SOAR
- Create meaningful dashboards
- Build observability for your infrastructure
